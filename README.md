dustr
=====

This is the code behind dustr.org, an online dustjs template compiler.

This is a pure javascript application without any server backend. It does a simple task: compile dust templates, and it does it well.

Feel free to fork this project and modify it for your needs. I'll accept any pull requests which make sense.
